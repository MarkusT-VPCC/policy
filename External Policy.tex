        &&&& "Head Delegate" refers to a member that is the Vice-President External or a selected attending delegate;
        &&&& "Delegate" refers to a member that is selected by the External Committee to represent Lassonde at external activities;
        &&&& "ESSCO" refers to the Engineering Students Societies' Council of Ontario; and
        &&&& "CFES" refers to the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students.
&& Interpretation
    &&& All external activity fees will be regulated by the Section 4 of the Accessibility Policy
        &&&& The Vice-President External shall be waived of all ESSCO and CFES activity fees.
    &&& As per Bylaw 1, all LES Bylaws shall have precedence over this policy.
&& Oversight by the External Committee
    &&& The External Committee is responsible for overseeing the business described in this policy. The ultimate responsibility for the implementation of these policies will rest with the Vice-President External.
