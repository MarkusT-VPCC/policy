&& Purpose and Principles
    &&& The purpose of this bylaw is to describe the procedure by which Student Organizations and Professional Organizations can partner with the Lassonde Engineering Society and outline the procedures and details of that partnership.
    &&& The views of a Partner Organization do not necessarily reflect the views of LES. No Partner Organization may claim to speak on behalf of the Society.
&& Interpretations
    &&& In any situations where this Bylaw contradicts Bylaw 1, Bylaw 1 shall have precedence.
    &&& The Digital Standards, Space Management and Finance policies shall take precedence over this policy.
&& Definitions
    &&& In this document:
        &&&& Lassonde Engineering Society shall be referred to as “LES”;
        &&&& The Board of Directors will be referred to as “BOD”;
        &&&& Student Executive Partner shall be referred to as “SEP”;
        &&&& Student Associate Partner shall be referred to as “SAP”;
        &&&& Professional Partner Organization shall be referred to as “PPO”;
        &&&& A motion that is presented at BOD to create a partnership with an organization shall be referred to as a “Motion of Partnership”;
        &&&& A motion that is presented at BOD to renew a previously created partnership with an organization shall be referred to as a “Motion of Partnership Renewal” ;
        &&&& A motion that is presented at BOD to dissolve a partnership with an Organization shall be referred to as a “Motion of Partnership Dissolution”;
        &&&& A document containing up-to-date information on the details of the partnership with each organization shall be referred to as a “Partner Organization Agreements Document”.
        &&&& The application that student organizations will use to request funding shall be called “Student Organization Funding Application” (SOFA).
        &&&& A Memorandum of Understanding shall be referred to as an "MOU"
